# 📘 GOAP System

This repository is purely a collection of c# scripts that i used to analyze and understand the GOAP system for game development.

I also used Claude Sonnet 4.5 ( Thinking ) for analysis and documentation so its easier to understand for others. (Remember, its AI generated so it may contain errors that i will correct in due time)
